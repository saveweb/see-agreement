If you choose not to provide data required to operate and provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use the data will not work for you.</p> <p><strong><em>The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make (including your privacy settings), the products and features you use, your location, and applicable law</em></strong>.</p> <p>The data we collect can include the following:</p> <p><strong>Name and contact data</strong>. Your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.</p> <p><strong>Credentials</strong>. Passwords, password hints, and similar security information used for authentication and account access.</p> <p><strong>Demographic data</strong>. Data about you such as your age, gender, country, and preferred language.</p> <p><strong>Payment data</strong>. Data to process payments, such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number) and the security code associated with your payment instrument.</p> <p><strong>Subscription and licensing data</strong>. Information about your subscriptions, licenses, and other entitlements.</p> <p><strong>Interactions</strong>. Data about your use of Microsoft products. In some cases, such as search queries, this is data you provide in order to make use of the products. In other cases, such as error reports, this is data we generate. Other examples of interactions data include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Device and usage data</strong>. Data about your device and the product and features you use, including information about your hardware and software, how our products perform, as well as your settings. For example:<ul> <li><strong>Payment and account history</strong>. Data about the items you purchase and activities associated with your account.</li> <li><strong>Browse history</strong>. Data about the webpages you visit.</li> <li><strong>Device, connectivity, and configuration data</strong>. Data about your device, your device configuration, and nearby networks. For example, data about the operating systems and other software installed on your device, including product keys. In addition, IP address, device identifiers (such as the IMEI number for phones), regional and language settings, and information about WLAN access points near your device.</li> <li><strong>Error reports and performance data</strong>. Data about the performance of the products and any problems you experience, including error reports. Error reports (sometimes called “crash dumps”) can include details of the software or hardware related to an error, contents of files opened when an error occurred, and data about other software on your device.</li> <li><strong>Troubleshooting and help data</strong>. Data you provide when you contact Microsoft for help, such as the products you use, and other details that help us provide support. For example, contact or authentication data, the content of your chats and other communications with Microsoft, data about the condition of your device, and the products you use related to your help inquiry. When you contact us, such as for customer support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and recorded.</li> <li><strong>Bot usage data</strong>. Interactions with third party bots and skills available through Microsoft products.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Interests and favorites</strong>. Data about your interests and favorites, such as the sports teams you follow, the programming languages you prefer, the stocks you track, or cities you add to track things like weather or traffic. In addition to those you explicitly provide, your interests and favorites can also be inferred or derived from other data we collect.</li> <li><strong>Content consumption data</strong>. Information about media content (e.g., TV, video, music, audio, text books, apps, and games) you access through our products.</li> <li><strong>Searches and commands</strong>. Search queries and commands when you use Microsoft products with search or related productivity functionality.</li> <li><strong>Voice data</strong>. Your voice data, sometimes referred to as “voice clips”, such as search queries, commands, or dictation you speak, which may include background sounds.</li> <li><strong>Text, inking, and typing data</strong>. Text, inking, and typing data and related information. For example, when we collect inking data, we collect information about the placement of your inking instrument on your device.</li> <li><strong>Images</strong>.

Data about your device’s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. For example, we collect location data using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) (e.g., GPS) and data about nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots. Location can also be inferred from a device’s IP address or data in your account profile that indicates where it is located with less precision, such as at a city or postal code level.</li> <li><strong>Other input</strong>. Other inputs provided when you use our products. For example, data such as the buttons you press on an Xbox wireless controller using the Xbox network, skeletal tracking data when you use Kinect, and other sensor data, like the number of steps you take, when you use devices that have applicable sensors. And, if you use Spend, at your direction, we also collect financial transaction data from your credit card issuer to provide the service. If you attend an in-store event, we collect the data you provide to us when registering for or during the event and if you enter into a prize promotion, we collect the data you input into the entry form.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Content</strong>. Content of your files and communications you input, upload, receive, create, and control. For example, if you transmit a file using Skype to another Skype user, we need to collect the content of that file to display it to you and the other user. If you receive an email using Outlook.com, we need to collect the content of that email to deliver it to your inbox, display it to you, enable you to reply to it, and store it for you until you choose to delete it. Other content we collect when providing products to you include:</p> <ul> <li>Communications, including audio, video, text (typed, inked, dictated, or otherwise), in a message, email, call, meeting request, or chat.</li> <li>Photos, images, songs, movies, software, and other media or documents you store, retrieve, or otherwise process with our cloud.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Video or recordings</strong>. Recordings of events and activities at Microsoft buildings, retail spaces, and other locations. If you enter Microsoft Store locations or other facilities, or attend a Microsoft event that is recorded, we may process your image and voice data.</p> <p><strong>Feedback and ratings</strong>. Information you provide to us and the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback, survey data, and product reviews you write.</p> <p><strong>Traffic data</strong>. Data generated through your use of Microsoft’s communications services. Traffic data indicates with whom you have communicated and when your communications occurred. We will process your traffic data only as required to provide, maintain, and improve our communications services and we do so with your consent.</p> <p>Product-specific sections below describe data collection practices applicable to use of those products.</p> <p>View Summary</p> <h4 id=how-we-use-personal-data>How we use personal data<a class=headerlink href=#how-we-use-personal-data title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:</p> <ul> <li>Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.</li> <li>Improve and develop our products.</li> <li>Personalize our products and make recommendations.</li> <li>Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you relevant offers.</li> </ul> <p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p> <p>For these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products). For example, Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations. However, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law. For example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p> <p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies. This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.</p> <p>When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule>Reasons we share personal data</a> section of this privacy statement. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule>Where we store and process personal data</a> section of this privacy statement.</p> <p><strong>More on the purposes of processing:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Provide our products</strong>. We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.</li> <li><strong>Product improvement</strong>. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy.</li> <li><strong>Personalization</strong>. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.</li> <li><strong>Product activation</strong>. We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation.</li> <li><strong>Product development</strong>. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products.</li> <li><strong>Customer support</strong>. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable Microsoft to provide support services and investigate security incidents.</li> <li><strong>Help secure and troubleshoot</strong>. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.</li> <li><strong>Safety</strong>. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook.com or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. <strong>In accordance with European Union Regulation (EU) 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 5(1) and 6(1) of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures (known as “hashes”) of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery (known as a “hash set”), in a process called “hash matching”. Microsoft obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement authorities.</strong></li> <li><strong>Updates</strong>. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates.</li> <li><strong>Promotional communications</strong>. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule>How to access and control your personal data</a> section of this privacy statement.</li> <li><strong>Relevant offers</strong>. Microsoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.</li> <li><strong>Advertising</strong>. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products, and on third-party web properties, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you. For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainadvertisingmodule>Advertising</a> section of this privacy statement.</li> <li><strong>Prize promotions and events</strong>. We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Microsoft Stores. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win. Or, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees.</li> <li><strong>Transacting commerce</strong>. We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Microsoft Store.</li> <li><strong>Reporting and business operations</strong>. We use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence. This enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.</li> <li><strong>Protecting rights and property</strong>. We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.</li> <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong>. We process data to comply with law. For example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children’s privacy. We also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights.</li> <li><strong>Research.</strong> With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard individuals’ rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes.</li> </ul> <p>View Summary</p> <h4 id=reasons-we-share-personal-data>Reasons we share personal data<a class=headerlink href=#reasons-we-share-personal-data title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you send an email to a friend, share photos and documents on OneDrive, or link accounts with another service. If you use a Microsoft product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, or use an email address provided by such organization to access Microsoft products, we share certain data, such as interaction data and diagnostic data to enable your organization to manage the products. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.</p> <p>In addition, we share personal data among Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.</p> <p>Finally, we will retain, access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails in Outlook.com, or files in private folders on OneDrive), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to do any of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies.</li> <li>Protect our customers, for example, to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.</li> <li>Operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.</li> <li>Protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services—however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.</li> </ul> <p>For more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/about/corporate-responsibility/lerr/ >Law Enforcement Requests Report</a>.</p> <p>Please note that some of our products include links to or otherwise enable you to access products of third parties whose privacy practices differ from those of Microsoft. If you provide personal data to any of those products, your data is governed by their privacy policies.</p> <p>View Summary</p> <h4 id=how-to-access-and-control-your-personal-data>How to access and control your personal data<a class=headerlink href=#how-to-access-and-control-your-personal-data title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>You can also make choices about the collection and use of your data by Microsoft. You can control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, by contacting Microsoft or using various tools we provide. In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law. How you can access or control your personal data will also depend on which products you use. For example, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from Microsoft by visiting our <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759">opt-out page</a>.</li> <li>Choose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls, and postal mail from Microsoft.</li> <li>Access and clear some of your data through the <a href=https://account.microsoft.com/privacy>Microsoft privacy dashboard</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Not all personal data processed by Microsoft can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainhowtocontactusmodule>How to contact us</a> section or by using our <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2126612">web form</a>.</p> <p>We provide aggregate metrics about user requests to exercise their data protection rights via the <a href=https://aka.ms/PrivacyReport>Microsoft Privacy Report</a>.</p> <p>You can access and control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained with tools Microsoft provides to you, which are described below, or by contacting Microsoft. For instance:</p> <ul> <li>If Microsoft obtained your consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time.</li> <li>You can request access to, erasure of, and updates to your personal data.</li> <li>If you’d like to port your data elsewhere, you can use tools Microsoft provides to do so, or if none are available, you can contact Microsoft for assistance.</li> </ul> <p>You can also object to or restrict the use of your personal data by Microsoft. For example, you can object at any time to our use of your personal data:</p> <ul> <li>For direct marketing purposes.</li> <li>Where we are performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party.</li> </ul> <p>You may have these rights under applicable laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but we offer them regardless of your location. In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law.</p> <p>If your organization, such as your employer, school, or service provider, provides you with access to and is administering your use of Microsoft products, contact your organization to learn more about how to access and control your personal data.</p> <p>You can access and control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, using various tools we provide.

We will respond to requests to control your personal data as required by applicable law.</p> <p><strong>Your communications preferences</strong></p> <p>You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with your personal Microsoft account, and viewing your <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243191">communication permissions</a> where you can update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners. If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243189">web form</a>. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, activities, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.</p> <p><strong>Your advertising choices</strong></p> <p>To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft, visit our <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759">opt-out page</a>. When you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.</p> <p>You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account. It will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.</p> <p>For Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.</p> <p>Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other required purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection. You will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.</p> <p>You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).</p> <p><strong>Browser-based controls</strong></p> <p>When you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain features. For example:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Cookie controls</strong>. You can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule>Cookies</a> section of this privacy statement.</li> <li><strong>Tracking protections</strong>. You can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) and Microsoft Edge. This feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add.</li> <li><strong>Browser controls for "Do Not Track."</strong> Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.</li> </ul> <p>View Summary</p> <h4 id=cookies-and-similar-technologies>Cookies and similar technologies<a class=headerlink href=#cookies-and-similar-technologies title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. This data often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Some cookies are placed by third parties acting on our behalf. We use cookies and similar technologies to store and honor your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our products perform, and fulfill other legitimate purposes described below. Microsoft apps use additional identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows, for similar purposes, and many of our websites and applications also contain web beacons or other similar technologies, as described below.</p> <p><strong>Our use of cookies and similar technologies</strong></p> <p>Microsoft uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending on the context or product, including:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Storing your preferences and settings</strong>. We use cookies to store your preferences and settings on your device, and to enhance your experiences. For example, depending on your settings, if you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft website, we store that data in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. Saving your preferences with cookies, such as your preferred language, prevents you from having to set your preferences repeatedly. If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device.

Personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favorites. Signing into your Microsoft account enables personalization, consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features. There are three types of Microsoft account:</p> <ul> <li>When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a <strong>personal Microsoft account</strong>.</li> <li>When you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a <strong>work or school account</strong>.</li> <li>When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a <strong>third-party account</strong>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Personal Microsoft accounts</strong>. The data associated with your personal Microsoft account, and how that data is used, depends on how you use the account.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Creating your Microsoft account</strong>. When you create a personal Microsoft account, you will be asked to provide certain personal data and we will assign a unique ID number to identify your account and associated information. While some products, such as those involving payment, require a real name, you can sign in to and use other Microsoft products without providing your real name. Some data you provide, such as your display name, email address, and phone number, can be used to help others find and connect with you within Microsoft products. For example, people who know your display name, email address, or phone number can use it to search for you on Skype or Microsoft Teams for personal use and send you an invite to connect with them. Note that if you use a work or school email address to create a personal Microsoft account, your employer or school may gain access to your data. In some cases, you will need to change the email address to a personal email address in order to continue accessing consumer-oriented products (such as the Xbox network).</li> <li><strong>Signing in to Microsoft account</strong>. When you sign in to your Microsoft account, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, information about the product you signed in to, your sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, a unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address, and your operating system and browser version.</li> <li><strong>Signing in to Microsoft products</strong>. Signing in to your account enables improved personalization, provides seamless and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to access and use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other enhanced features and settings. When you sign in to your account, you will stay signed in until you sign out. If you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device (version 8 or higher), Windows will automatically sign you in to products that use Microsoft account when you access those products on that device. When you are signed in, some products will display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) as part of your use of Microsoft products, including in your communications, social interactions, and public posts.</li> <li><strong>Signing in to third-party products</strong>. If you sign in to a third-party product with your Microsoft account, you will share data with the third party in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy. The third party will also receive the version number assigned to your account (a new version number is assigned each time you change your sign-in data); and information that describes whether your account has been deactivated. If you share your profile data, the third party can display your name or user name and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) when you are signed in to that third-party product. If you chose to make payments to third-party merchants using your Microsoft account, Microsoft will pass information stored in your Microsoft account to the third party or its vendors (e.g., payment processors) as necessary to process your payment and fulfill your order (such as name, credit card number, billing and shipping addresses, and relevant contact information). The third party can use or share the data it receives when you sign in or make a purchase according to its own practices and policies. <strong>You should carefully review the privacy statement for each product you sign in to and each merchant you purchase from to determine how it will use the data it collects</strong>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Work or school accounts</strong>. The data associated with a work or school account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account.</p> <p>If your employer or school uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) to manage the account it provides you, you can use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft products, such as Microsoft 365 and Office 365, and third-party products provided to you by your organization. If required by your organization, you will also be asked to provide a phone number or an alternative email address for additional security verification. And, if allowed by your organization, you may also use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft or third-party products that you acquire for yourself.</p> <p>If you sign in to Microsoft products with a work or school account, note:</p> <ul> <li>The owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files, including data stored in products provided to you by your organization, and products you acquire by yourself.</li> <li>Your use of the products is subject to your organization’s policies, if any. You should consider both your organization’s policies and whether you are comfortable enabling your organization to access your data before you choose to use your work or school account to sign in to products you acquire for yourself.</li> <li>If you lose access to your work or school account (if you change employers, for example), you may lose access to products, including content associated with those products, you acquired on your own behalf if you used your work or school account to sign in to such products.</li> <li>Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organization, which may differ from those of Microsoft.</li> <li>If your organization is administering your use of Microsoft products, please direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data subject rights, to your administrator. See also the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainnoticetoendusersmodule>Notice to end users</a> section of this privacy statement.</li> <li>If you are uncertain whether your account is a work or school account, please contact your organization.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Third-party accounts</strong>. The data associated with a third-party Microsoft account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account. Your service provider has control over your account, including the ability to access or delete your account. <strong>You should carefully review the terms the third party provided you to understand what it can do with your account</strong>.</p> <p>View Summary</p> <h4 id=collection-of-data-from-children>Collection of data from children<a class=headerlink href=#collection-of-data-from-children title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>When a Microsoft product collects age, and there is an age in your jurisdiction under which parental consent or authorization is required to use the product, the product will either block users under that age or will ask them to provide consent or authorization from a parent or guardian before they can use it. We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is required to provide for the product.</p> <p>Once parental consent or authorization is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account. The child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages. <a href=https://support.microsoft.com/help/4090274/microsoft-account-parental-consent-and-child-accounts>Learn more about parental consent and Microsoft child accounts</a>.</p> <p>Parents or guardians can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit, or request the deletion of the personal data of the children for whom they provided consent or authorization. As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, the parent or guardian can manage a child’s information and settings on their <a href=https://account.microsoft.com/family>Family Safety</a> page and view and delete a child’s data on their <a href=https://account.microsoft.com/privacy>privacy dashboard</a>.</p> <p>Below is additional information about the collection of data from children as related to Xbox.</p> <p><strong>What is Xbox?</strong> Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft. Xbox hosts an online network that consists of software and enables online experiences crossing multiple platforms. This network lets your child find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks. Children can connect to the Xbox network using Xbox consoles, Windows devices, and mobile devices (Android and iPhone).</p> <p>Xbox consoles are devices your child can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment. When they sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on a console, we assign a unique identifier to their device. For instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system they are using.</p> <p>Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming. When signed in to an Xbox experience, we collect required data to help keep these experiences reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected.</p> <p><strong>Data we collect when you create an Xbox profile</strong>. You as the parent or guardian are required to consent to the collection of personal data from a child under 13 years old. With your permission, your child can have an Xbox profile and use the online Xbox network. During the child Xbox profile creation, you will sign in with your own Microsoft account to verify that you are an adult organizer in your Microsoft family group. We collect an alternate email address or phone number to boost account security. If your child needs help accessing their account, they will be able to use one of these alternates to validate they own the Microsoft account.</p> <p>We collect limited information about children, including name, birthdate, email address, and region. When you sign your child up for an Xbox profile, they get a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier. When you create your child’s Xbox profile you consent to Microsoft collecting, using, and sharing information based on their privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network. Your child’s privacy and communication settings are defaulted to the most restrictive.</p> <p><strong>Data we collect</strong>. We collect information about your child’s use of Xbox services, games, apps, and devices including:</p> <ul> <li>When they sign in and sign out of Xbox, purchase history, and content they obtain.</li> <li>Which games they play and apps they use, their game progress, achievements, play time per game, and other play statistics.</li> <li>Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected accessories, and network connection, including any software or hardware errors.</li> <li>Content they add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video they capture in games and apps.</li> <li>Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections they make (friends they add and people who follow them) on the Xbox network.</li> </ul> <p>If your child uses an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time they sign in to Xbox, even if they have been playing offline.</p> <p><strong>Xbox console diagnostic data</strong>. If your child uses an Xbox console, the console will send required data to Microsoft. Required data is the minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.</p> <p><strong>Game captures</strong>. Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play. Other players’ game clips and screenshots can capture your child’s in-game character and gamertag during that session. If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat if your child’s privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network allow it.</p> <p><strong>Captioning</strong>. During Xbox real-time (“party”) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text. If a player activates this feature, Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it. This data may also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the <a href=https://www.xbox.com/legal/codeofconduct>Community Standards for Xbox</a>.</p> <p><strong>Data use</strong>. Microsoft uses the data we collect to improve gaming products and experiences— making it safer and more fun over time. Data we collect also enables us to provide your child with personalized, curated experiences. This includes connecting them to games, content, services, and recommendations.</p> <p><strong>Xbox data viewable by others</strong>. When your child is using the Xbox network, their online presence (which can be set to “appear offline” or “blocked”), gamertag, game play statistics, and achievements are visible to other players on the network. Depending on how you set your child’s Xbox safety settings, they might share information when playing or communicating with others on the Xbox network.</p> <p>In order to help make the Xbox network a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox, we may collect and review voice, text, images, videos and in-game content (such as game clips your child uploads, conversations they have, and things they post in clubs and games).</p> <p><strong>Xbox data shared with game and apps publishers</strong>. When your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about their usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product. This data may include: your child’s Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your child’s in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game or types of vehicles used in-game), your child’s presence on the Xbox network, the time they spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs they belong to, official club memberships, and any content they create or submit in the game or app.</p> <p>Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies. You should carefully review their policies to determine how they use your child’s data. For example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services. You may find their policies linked from the game or app detail pages in our stores.</p> <p>Learn more at <a href=https://www.xbox.com/Legal/ThirdPartyDataSharing>Data Sharing with Games and Apps</a>.</p> <p>To stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where they have been installed. Some publisher access to your child’s data may be revoked at <a href=https://microsoft.com/consent>microsoft.com/consent</a>.</p> <p><strong>Managing child settings</strong>. As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, you can manage a child’s information and settings on their <a href=https://account.microsoft.com/family>Family Safety</a> page, as well as their Xbox profile privacy settings from their <a href=https://account.xbox.com/settings>Xbox Privacy &amp; online safety page</a>.</p> <p>You can also use the <a href=https://www.xbox.com/apps/family-settings-app>Xbox Family Settings</a> app to manage your child’s experience on the Xbox Network including: spending for Microsoft and Xbox stores, viewing your child’s Xbox activity, and setting age ratings and the amount of screen time.</p> <p>Learn more about managing Xbox profiles at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2170314">Xbox online safety and privacy settings</a>.</p> <p>Learn more about Microsoft family groups at <a href=https://account.microsoft.com/family/about>Simplify your family’s life</a>.</p> <p><strong>Accessing child data</strong>. As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, a parent can view and delete a child’s data on their <a href=https://account.microsoft.com/privacy>privacy dashboard</a>. The dashboard allows you to review your child's personal information, have it deleted, and refuse to permit further collection or use of your child's information.</p> <p>To close your child’s account, sign in with their account info at <a href=https://account.microsoft.com/profile>account.microsoft.com/profile</a> and select ”How to close your account.”</p> <p><strong>Legacy</strong>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Xbox 360</strong>. This Xbox console collects limited required diagnostic data. This data helps keep your child’s console functioning as expected.</li> <li><strong>Kinect</strong>. The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that can enable motions and voice to be used to control game play.

You can find more information on Microsoft and our commitment to protecting your privacy at <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com>Microsoft Privacy</a>.</p> <p>View Summary</p> <h4 id=security-of-personal-data>Security of personal data<a class=headerlink href=#security-of-personal-data title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential data (such as a credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption. Microsoft complies with applicable data protection laws, including applicable security breach notification laws.</p> <h4 id=where-we-store-and-process-personal-data>Where we store and process personal data<a class=headerlink href=#where-we-store-and-process-personal-data title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Personal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities. Microsoft maintains major data centers in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Typically, the primary storage location is in the customer’s region or in the United States, often with a backup to a data center in another region. The storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem. We take steps to process the data that we collect under this privacy statement according to this statement’s provisions and the requirements of applicable law.</p> <p>We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts such as the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914, to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on <a href=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en>the European Commission website</a>.</p> <p>Microsoft Corporation complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although Microsoft does not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18. Microsoft Corporation has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. The controlled U.S. subsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles—for more info, see the list of <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/entity-list-adhering-to-privacy-shield>Microsoft U.S. entities or subsidiaries adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles</a>.</p> <p>If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, visit the <a href=https://www.privacyshield.gov/ >Privacy Shield website</a>.</p> <p>If you have a question or complaint related to participation by Microsoft in the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, we encourage you to contact us via our <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2126612">web form</a>. For any complaints related to the Privacy Shield frameworks that Microsoft cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals. Please contact us if you’d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts. As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other means. Microsoft is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p> <h4 id=our-retention-of-personal-data>Our retention of personal data<a class=headerlink href=#our-retention-of-personal-data title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.</p> <p>Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?</strong> Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox. In such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion). (Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)</li> <li><strong>Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?</strong> If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li> <li><strong>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</strong> If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.</li> <li><strong>Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?</strong> For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.</li> <li><strong>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</strong> If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.</li> <li><strong>Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?</strong> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.</li> </ul> <h4 id=california-consumer-privacy-act>California Consumer Privacy Act<a class=headerlink href=#california-consumer-privacy-act title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>If you are a California resident, we process your personal data in accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This CCPA section of our Privacy Statement contains information required by the CCPA and supplements our Privacy Statement.</p> <p><strong>Sale.</strong> We do not sell your personal data. So, we do not offer an opt-out to the sale of personal data.</p> <p><strong>Rights.</strong> You have the right to request that we (i) disclose what personal data we collect, use, disclose, and sell and (ii) delete your personal data. You may make these requests yourself or through an authorized agent. If you use an authorized agent, we provide your agent with <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/ccpa-guidance>detailed guidance</a> on how to exercise your CCPA rights.</p> <p>If you have a Microsoft account, you must exercise your rights through the <a href=https://account.microsoft.com/privacy>Microsoft privacy dashboard</a>, which requires you to log in to your Microsoft account. If you have an additional request or questions after using the dashboard, you may contact Microsoft at the address in the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainhowtocontactusmodule>How to contact us</a> section, use our <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2126612">web form</a>, or call our US toll free number 1.844.931.2038. If you do not have an account, you may exercise your rights by contacting us as described above. We may ask for additional information, such as your country of residence, email address, and phone number, to validate your request before honoring the request.</p> <p>You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment if you exercise your CCPA rights. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your CCPA rights.</p> <p><strong>Personal Information Processing</strong>.

Similarly, we process all categories of personal data for the purposes described in the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainhowweusepersonaldatamodule>How we use personal data</a> section, such as meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p> <p><strong>Disclosures of personal data for business or commercial purposes</strong>. As indicated in the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule>Reasons we share personal data</a> section, we share personal data with third parties for various business and commercial purposes. The primary business and commercial purposes for which we share personal data are the purposes of processing listed in the table above. However, we share all categories of personal data for the business and commercial purposes in the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule>Reasons we share personal data</a> section.</p> <p>See our <a href=https://aka.ms/ccpa>CCPA Notice</a> for additional information.</p> <h4 id=advertising>Advertising<a class=headerlink href=#advertising title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Advertising allows us to provide, support, and improve some of our products. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use other data, detailed below, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Microsoft may use data we collect to select and deliver some of the ads you see on Microsoft web properties, such as <a href=https://www.microsoft.com>Microsoft.com</a>, MSN, and Bing.</li> <li>When the advertising ID is enabled in Windows as part of your privacy settings, third parties can access and use the advertising ID (much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie) to select and deliver ads in such apps.</li> <li>We may share data we collect with partners, such as Verizon Media, AppNexus, or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in our products and their products are more relevant and valuable to you.</li> <li>Advertisers may choose to place our web beacons on their sites, or use similar technologies, in order to allow Microsoft to collect information on their sites such as activities, purchases, and visits; we use this data on behalf of our advertising customers to provide ads.</li> </ul> <p>The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your search queries, or the content you view. For example, if you view content on MSN about automobiles, we may show advertisements about cars; if you search “pizza places in Seattle” on Bing, you may see advertisements in your search results for restaurants in Seattle.</p> <p>The ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data from our products and sites, and the information we collect about you from the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners. We refer to these ads as "personalized advertising" in this statement. For example, if you view gaming content on <a href=https://www.xbox.com>xbox.com</a>, you may see offers for games on MSN. To provide personalized advertising, we combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such as IP address) when your browser interacts with our websites. If you opt out of receiving personalized advertising, data associated with these cookies will not be used.</p> <p>We may use information about you to serve you with personalized advertising when you use Microsoft services. If you are logged in with your Microsoft account and have consented to allow Microsoft Edge to use your online activity for personalized advertising, you will see offers for products and services based on your online activity while using Microsoft Edge. To configure your privacy settings for Edge, go to Microsoft Edge &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy and Services.

In the United States, we provide personalized advertising based on a limited number of standard, non-sensitive health-related interest categories, including allergies, arthritis, cholesterol, cold and flu, diabetes, gastrointestinal health, headache / migraine, healthy eating, healthy heart, men’s health, oral health, osteoporosis, skin health, sleep, and vision / eye care. We will also personalize ads based on custom, non-sensitive health-related interest categories as requested by advertisers.</li> <li><strong>Children and advertising</strong>. We do not deliver personalized advertising to children whose birthdate in their Microsoft account identifies them as under 18 years of age.</li> <li><strong>Data retention</strong>. For personalized advertising, we retain data for no more than 13 months, unless we obtain your consent to retain the data longer.</li> <li><strong>Data sharing</strong>. In some cases, we share with advertisers reports about the data we have collected on their sites or ads.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Data collected by other advertising companies</strong>. Advertisers sometimes include their own web beacons (or those of their other advertising partners) within their advertisements that we display, enabling them to set and read their own cookie. Additionally, Microsoft partners with third-party ad companies to help provide some of our advertising services, and we also allow other third-party ad companies to display advertisements on our sites. These third parties may place cookies on your computer and collect data about your online activities across websites or online services.

Microsoft provides both device-based speech recognition features and cloud-based (online) speech recognition features. Microsoft’s speech recognition technology transcribes voice data into text. With your permission, Microsoft employees and vendors working on behalf of Microsoft, will be able to review snippets of your voice data or voice clips in order to build and improve our speech recognition technologies. These improvements allow us to build better voice-enabled capabilities that benefit users across all our consumer and enterprise products and services. Prior to employee or vendor review of voice data, we protect users’ privacy by taking steps to de-identify the data, requiring non-disclosure agreements with relevant vendors and their employees, and requiring that employees and vendors meet high privacy standards. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2145715">Learn more about Microsoft and your voice data</a>.</p> <h4 id=preview-or-free-of-charge-releases>Preview or free-of-charge releases<a class=headerlink href=#preview-or-free-of-charge-releases title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Microsoft offers preview, insider, beta or other free-of-charge products and features ("previews") to enable you to evaluate them while providing Microsoft with data about your use of the product, including feedback and device and usage data. As a result, previews can automatically collect additional data, provide fewer controls, and otherwise employ different privacy and security measures than those typically present in our products.

For more details about Outlook, see the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainoutlookmodule>Outlook</a> section of this privacy statement. Microsoft 365 is a service that is comprised of client software applications and connected online services that span many platforms and have numerous interdependent experiences. Various Microsoft 365 services enable you to use your file content for designs and recommendations, collaborate with others within your documents, and provide you functionality from other Microsoft products, such as Bing and Cortana, and third-party connected products. If you work in an organization, your administrator may turn off or disable these connected services. You can access the privacy controls within your Office apps by selecting <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> &gt; <strong>Account Privacy</strong>. See <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086538">Account Privacy Settings</a> for more information.</p> <p><strong>Office Roaming Service</strong>. The Office Roaming Service helps keep your Microsoft 365 settings up to date across your devices running Microsoft 365. When you sign in to Microsoft 365 with your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the Office Client Policy Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings to Microsoft servers (such as a list of most recently used documents and the last location viewed within a document). When you sign in to Microsoft 365 on another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device. The Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings when you sign in to Office.com. When you sign out of Microsoft 365, the Office Roaming Service removes your Microsoft 365 settings from your device. Any changes you make to your customized Microsoft 365 settings are sent to Microsoft servers.</p> <p><strong>Microsoft Updates</strong>. Microsoft uses services such as Click-to-Run or Microsoft AutoUpdate to provide you with security and other important updates.</p> <p><strong>Click-to-Run Update Service</strong>. The Click-to-Run Update Service allows you to install certain Microsoft 365 products over the internet. The Click-to-Run Update Service also automatically detects online updates to Click-to-Run-enabled products on your device and downloads and installs them automatically.</p> <p><strong>Translator</strong>. Translator used in Office apps is designed as a no-trace connected experience. With <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/translator/business/notrace/ >no trace</a> connected experience, no portion of your translation request that gets sent to Microsoft Translator API service will be logged, your submitted text will not be used to improve the quality of the Microsoft Translator service, and there will not be any record of any portion of your data retained by Microsoft.</p> <p><strong>Diagnostic Data</strong>. Diagnostic data is used to (i) keep your Office apps secure and up to date; (ii) detect, diagnose, and remediate problems; and (iii) make product improvements. This data does not include a user's name or email address, the content of the user's files, or information about apps unrelated to Office. Users have a choice between two different levels of diagnostic data collection, Required and Optional.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Required</strong>. The minimum data necessary to help keep Office apps secure, up to date, and performing as expected on the device it's installed on.</li> <li><strong>Optional</strong>. Additional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.</li> </ul> <p>See <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083611">Diagnostic Data in Office</a> for more information.</p> <p><strong>Connected Experiences</strong>. Microsoft 365 continues to provide more experiences in client applications that are connected to and backed by cloud-based services. If you choose to use connected experiences, required service data will be collected to help keep these connected experiences reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected.</p> <p>Microsoft 365 consists of client software applications and connected experiences designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively. Working with others on a document stored on OneDrive for Business or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences. There are two types of connected experiences.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Experiences that analyze your content</strong>. Experiences that use your Office content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features. For example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.</li> <li><strong>Experiences that download online content</strong>. Experiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents. For example, templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter.</li> </ul> <p>You can access the privacy controls within your Office apps by selecting <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> &gt; <strong>Account Privacy</strong>. These privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences. For example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content. Turning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage. But even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below.</p> <p>If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.</p> <p>There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 functions and cannot be disabled. For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential. Required service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured. See <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086224">Essential Services</a> for more information.</p> <p><strong>Required service data for connected experiences</strong>. As you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience. This data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences. We refer to this data as required service data.</p> <p>Required service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected. If you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience. Your text and the translation are not stored by our service. Required service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Office app.</p> <p>See <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2086313">Required service data for Office</a> for more information.</p> <h4 id=microsoft-teams>Microsoft Teams<a class=headerlink href=#microsoft-teams title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>This section applies to the consumer offering of Teams; if you are using Teams with a school or work account, see the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainenterpriseservicesmodule>Enterprise and developer products</a> of this privacy statement.</p> <p>Teams is an all-in-one collaboration and communication hub. Teams lets you stay organised and connected across your entire life. Teams allows you to call people with voice or video calling. Teams allows you to easily find people, files, photos, conversations, tasks, and calendars in one convenient and secure place. Teams allows you to store confidential information like passwords, rewards numbers, or login information and share it with others within Teams. With your consent, you can share your location with friends and family.</p> <p>As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects data about the usage of the features as well as information about your communications, including the time and date of the communication and users that are part of the communication.</p> <p><strong>Teams profile</strong>. Your Teams profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account. To enable other people to find you on Teams (or products that interact with Teams for personal use, including Teams for enterprise) your display name and picture are visible to other users on Teams that have your contact information.</p> <p><strong>Device contacts</strong>. With your permission, Teams will sync your device contacts periodically and check for other Teams users that match contacts in your device’s address book. You are always in control of your contacts and can stop syncing at any time. If you choose to stop syncing your device contacts, any device contacts that have not been matched during the synchronization process will be deleted from Teams. If you wish to invite any of your device contacts to join a conversation, you can invite users to a 1:1 directly, or Microsoft can send an invitation on your behalf via SMS or email for invitations to group conversations. You can block users if you don’t want to receive their communications; additionally you can report a concern to Microsoft.</p> <p><strong>Third-party contacts.</strong> You can also choose to sync contacts from third-party providers. If you choose to unsync your third-party contacts on Teams, all third-party contacts are deleted from Teams. If you gave your consent to use those third-party contacts on other Microsoft apps and services, these contacts will still be available to those other Microsoft apps and services.</p> <p>You can remove third-party contacts from all Microsoft apps and services by removing third-party accounts from Teams. Please note that removing a third-party account from Teams may impact your experiences on other Microsoft apps and services that also use that third-party account.</p> <p><strong>Teams Calendar:</strong> You can also choose to sync your Teams calendar with calendars from third-party providers. You can stop syncing your Teams calendar anytime by removing a third-party account from Teams. If you have consented to use third-party data on other Microsoft apps and services, please note that removing this third-party account data in Teams may impact your experiences on other Microsoft apps and services.</p> <p><strong>Location sharing</strong>. You can share your static or live location with individuals or groups within Teams. You are in control and can stop sharing at any time. Sharing location for children is permitted with parental consent and in groups where an adult from the Microsoft family group is present.</p> <p><strong>Push notifications</strong>. To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Teams uses the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Teams has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service.</p> <p>If you don’t want to use the notification services for incoming Teams calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found on your device.</p> <h4 id=onedrive>OneDrive<a class=headerlink href=#onedrive title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share and collaborate on your files with others. Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Microsoft 365 or Office 365.</p> <p>When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services. Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.</p> <p>When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.</p> <p>When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network. Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.</p> <p>When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.</p> <p>Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service.</p> <h4 id=outlook>Outlook<a class=headerlink href=#outlook title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Outlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved communications and include Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services.</p> <p><strong>Outlook.com</strong>. Outlook.com is the primary consumer email service from Microsoft and includes email accounts with addresses that end in outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com, and msn.com. Outlook.com provides features that let you connect with your friends on social networks. You will need to create a Microsoft account to use Outlook.com.</p> <p>When you delete an email or item from a mailbox in Outlook.com, the item generally goes into your Deleted Items folder where it remains for approximately 7 days unless you move it back to your inbox, you empty the folder, or the service empties the folder automatically, whichever comes first. When the Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion, unless we are legally required to retain the data for longer.</p> <p><strong>Outlook applications</strong>. Outlook client applications are software you install on your device that permits you to manage email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other data from email, file storage, and other services, like Exchange Online or Outlook.com, or servers, like Microsoft Exchange. You can use multiple accounts from different providers, including third-party providers, with Outlook applications.</p> <p>To add an account, you must provide permission for Outlook to access data from the email or file storage services.</p> <p>When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device. If you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application. If you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.</p> <p>If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of Outlook.</p> <p>To learn more about the data the Outlook applications collect and process, please see the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainofficeservicesmodule>Microsoft 365</a> section of this privacy statement.</p> <h4 id=skype>Skype<a class=headerlink href=#skype title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Skype lets you send and receive voice, video, SMS, and instant message communications. This section applies to the consumer version of Skype; if you are using Skype for Business, see the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainenterpriseservicesmodule>Enterprise and developer products</a> section of this privacy statement.</p> <p>As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects usage data about your communications that includes the time and date of the communication and the numbers or user names that are part of the communication.</p> <p><strong>Skype profile</strong>. Your Skype profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account. To enable other people to find you on Skype (or products that interact with Skype, such as Skype for Business), depending on your profile settings, your Skype profile is included in the Skype public search. Your profile includes your user name, avatar, and any other data you choose to add to your profile or display to others.</p> <p><strong>Skype Contacts</strong>. If you use a Microsoft service, such as Outlook.com, to manage contacts, Skype will automatically add the people you know to your Skype contact list until you tell the application to stop. With your permission, Skype will also check your device to automatically add your friends as Skype contacts. You can block users if you don’t want to receive their communications.</p> <p><strong>Partner companies</strong>. To make Skype available to more people, we partner with other companies to allow Skype to be offered via those companies’ services. If you use Skype through a company other than Microsoft, that company’s privacy policy governs how it handles your data. To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, or to help our partner company or local operator comply or respond, we may access, transfer, disclose, and preserve your data. That data could include, for example, your private content, such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails, or file transfers.</p> <p><strong>Skype Manager</strong>. Skype Manager lets you manage a group’s (such as your family’s) Skype usage from one central place. When you set up a group, you will be the Skype Manager Administrator and can see the patterns of usage, including detailed information, like traffic data and details of purchases, of other members of the group who have consented to such access. If you add information like your name, other people in the group will be able to see it. Members of the group can withdraw consent for Skype Manager by visiting their <a href=https://login.skype.com/login>Skype account page</a>.</p> <p><strong>Push notifications</strong>. To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Skype apps use the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Skype has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service. If you don’t want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device.</p> <p><strong>Translation features</strong>. When you use Skype’s translation features, Skype collects and uses your conversation to provide the translation service. With your permission, your data may be used to help improve Microsoft products and services. To help the translation and speech recognition technology learn and grow, sentences and automatic transcripts are analyzed and any corrections are entered into our system, to build better performing services. This data may include manual transcription of your voice clips. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainspeechrecognitionmodule>Speech recognition technologies</a>.</p> <p><strong>Recording features</strong>. Some versions of Skype have a recording feature that allows you to capture and share all or part of your audio / video call. The recording will be stored and shared as part of your conversation history with the person or group with whom the call occurred. <strong>You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication. This may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.</strong> Microsoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.</p> <p><strong>Skype bots</strong>. Bots are programs offered by Microsoft or third parties that can do many useful things like search for news, play games, and more. Depending on their capabilities, bots may have access to your display name, Skype ID, country, region, language, and any messages, audio, video, or content that you share with the bot. Please review the bot profile and its privacy statement before engaging in a one-to-one or group conversation with a bot. You can delete a bot that you no longer wish to engage with. Prior to adding a bot to a group, please ensure that your group participants have consented to their information being shared with the bot.</p> <p><strong>Captioning</strong>. Certain Skype features include accessibility functionality such as captioning. During Skype calls, a call participant can activate a voice-to-text feature, which allows the user to view the audio chat as text. If a user activates this feature, other call participants will not receive a notification. Microsoft uses this voice and text data to provide captioning of audio for users.</p> <h4 id=surface-duo>Surface Duo<a class=headerlink href=#surface-duo title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>The Surface Duo is a device featuring two screens that fits in your pocket for productivity on the go.

You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.</p> <p><strong>Retention and de-identification</strong>. We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.</p> <p><strong>Personalization through Microsoft account</strong>. Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. Visit <a href=https://www.bing.com/account/general>Bing Settings</a> to manage your personalization settings, or the <a href=https://account.microsoft.com/privacy>Microsoft privacy dashboard</a> to manage your data.</p> <p><strong>Managing search history</strong>. When you’re signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search history on the <a href=https://account.microsoft.com/privacy>Microsoft privacy dashboard</a>. The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed on the Search History site, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard. If you are signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account using Microsoft Search in Bing, you can export your Microsoft Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it. Your Microsoft Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user.</p> <p><strong>Third-party services that use Bing</strong>. You may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!. In order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier). This data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service. Microsoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners. You should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.</p> <p><strong>Data passed to destination website</strong>. When you select a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit—such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the host name of the site you came from (in this case, <a href=https://www.bing.com/ >https://www.bing.com/</a>).</p> <p><strong>Sharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties</strong>. We share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties. Before we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.</p> <h4 id=cortana>Cortana<a class=headerlink href=#cortana title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Cortana is your personal productivity assistant in Microsoft 365.

Websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites.</li> </ul> <p>Microsoft collects data necessary to provide features you request in Microsoft Edge. For example, you may choose to sync browser information saved on your device across other devices when you are signed in with your Microsoft account. You may choose which browser data to sync, including your favorites, browsing history, extensions and associated data, settings, open tabs, autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), passwords, payment information, and other data types as they become available. If you choose to sync extensions that you acquired from third-party web stores, a copy of those extensions will be downloaded directly from those web stores on your synced device(s). If you have turned on Password Monitor, your saved credentials are hashed, encrypted and sent to Microsoft’s Password Monitor service to warn you if your credentials were detected as part of a malicious attack or a breach. Microsoft does not retain this data after the check is complete. You can disable or configure syncing in the Microsoft Edge settings.</p> <p>Microsoft Edge’s <strong>Search and site suggestions</strong> uses your search queries and browsing history to provide you with faster browsing and more relevant search recommendations. Microsoft Edge sends the information you type into the browser address bar to the default search provider configured in the address bar to offer search recommendations as you type each character. You can turn off these features at any time in the browser settings. In order to provide search results, Microsoft Edge sends your search queries, standard device information, and location (if you have location enabled) to your default search provider. If Bing is your default search provider, we use this data as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.</p> <p>Microsoft Edge collects and uses data from your search activity across the web, including websites Microsoft does not own or operate, to improve Microsoft services, such as Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Bing and Microsoft News. This data may include the search query, the search results that are displayed to you, demographic information that is part of the search results, and the interaction you have with those search results, such as the links you click. Microsoft Edge takes steps to de-identify the data it collects by removing data that identifies the person or device from which it was collected and retains this data for one year from when it is collected. Microsoft does not use this collected data to personalize or provide ads to you. You can turn off the collection of this data at any time in the browser settings.</p> <p>Microsoft Edge downloads content from Microsoft services to enhance your browsing experiences; for example, when data is downloaded to prerender site content for faster browsing or to provide content required to power features you choose to use, such as providing templates for Collections.</p> <p>You may also choose to share your Microsoft Edge browsing activity to allow us to personalize Microsoft Edge and Microsoft services like ads, search, shopping, and news.

We also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji predictions.</p> <p>SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model. This model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style. The model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey’s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered. The model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites. The SwiftKey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing password or payment data. SwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us (as described further below). When you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data. We use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products.</p> <p>The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account. If you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup. When you create a SwiftKey Account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data. All data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels.</p> <p>You may also opt in to share your language, typing data, and/or voice clips for the purposes of improving Microsoft products and services. Depending on the opt-ins you choose, SwiftKey may send short snippets of data about what and how you type and/or your voice clips, and related correction data to our servers for processing. These text snippets and/or voice clips are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements. To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to it. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainspeechrecognitionmodule>Speech recognition technologies</a>.</p> <p>If you sign into your SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data or voice clips, Microsoft will process your shared data in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our user base. This allows us to improve our basic models for individual languages. Language and typing data used in this process is aggregated and any words or combinations of words that might be personal to individuals or small groups of users are filtered out.</p> <p>You can withdraw your consent to share your language and typing data or voice clips for product improvement at any time in SwiftKey Settings. You can also withdraw your consent for SwiftKey Services to retain your personal data in SwiftKey Settings. When you withdraw consent for SwiftKey to retain your personal data, all personal data collected through your use of the SwiftKey Services will be deleted.</p> <p>You may receive occasional notifications on your device alerting you to product updates and features that may be of interest to you. You can disable these notifications at any time in the SwiftKey Settings.</p> <h3 id=windows>Windows<a class=headerlink href=#windows title="Permanent link">#</a></h3> <p>Windows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub. Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it. Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device. Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files. For more information about data collection in Windows, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529552">Data collection summary for Windows</a>. This statement discusses Windows 10 and Windows 11 and references to Windows in this section relate to those product versions. Earlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements.</p> <p>View Summary</p> <h4 id=activation>Activation<a class=headerlink href=#activation title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>When you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed. The product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to help validate your license to the software. This data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license. On phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power-up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.</p> <h4 id=activity-history>Activity history<a class=headerlink href=#activity-history title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Activity history helps keep track of the things you do on your device, such as the apps and services you use, the files you open, and the websites you browse. Your activity history is created when using different apps and features such as Microsoft Edge Legacy, some Microsoft Store apps, and Microsoft 365 apps and is stored locally on your device. If you've signed in to your device with a work or school account and give your permission, Windows sends your activity history to Microsoft. Once your activity history is in the cloud, Microsoft uses that data to enable cross-device experiences, to provide you with the ability to continue those activities on other devices, to provide personalized experiences (such as ordering your activities based on duration of use) and relevant suggestions (such as anticipating what your needs might be based on your activity history), and to help improve Microsoft products.</p> <p>You can turn settings off or on for sending your activity history to Microsoft and storing activity history locally on your device, and you can also clear your device’s activity history at any time by going to <strong>Privacy &gt; Activity history</strong> in the Windows settings app. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=865989">Learn more about activity history in Windows</a>.</p> <h4 id=advertising-id>Advertising ID<a class=headerlink href=#advertising-id title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Windows generates a unique advertising ID for each person using a device, which app developers and advertising networks can then use for their own purposes, including providing relevant advertising in apps. When the advertising ID is enabled, both Microsoft apps and third-party apps can access and use the advertising ID in much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie. Thus, your advertising ID can be used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising and other personalized experiences across their apps and on the web. Microsoft collects the advertising ID for the uses described here only when you choose to enable the advertising ID as part of your privacy setting.</p> <p>The advertising ID setting applies to Windows apps using the Windows advertising identifier. You can turn off access to this identifier at any time by turning off the advertising ID in the Windows settings app. If you choose to turn it on again, the advertising ID will be reset and a new identifier will be generated. When a third-party app accesses the advertising ID, its use of the advertising ID will be subject to its own privacy policy. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=838419">Learn more about advertising ID in Windows</a>.</p> <p>The advertising ID setting does not apply to other methods of interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft or third parties, such as cookies used to provide interest-based display ads on websites. Third-party products accessed through or installed on Windows may also deliver other forms of interest-based advertising subject to their own privacy policies. Microsoft delivers other forms of interest-based ads in certain Microsoft products, both directly and by partnering with third-party ad providers. For more information on how Microsoft uses data for advertising, see the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainadvertisingmodule>How we use personal data</a> section of this statement.</p> <h4 id=diagnostics>Diagnostics<a class=headerlink href=#diagnostics title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date, secure, and operating properly. It also helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services and, for customers who have turned on the “Tailored experiences” setting, to provide more relevant tips and recommendations to tailor Microsoft and third-party products and services for Windows to the customer’s needs. This data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns.</p> <p>There are two levels of diagnostic and activity data: Required diagnostic data and Optional diagnostic data. Certain product documentation and other materials refer to Required diagnostic data as Basic diagnostic data and to Optional diagnostic data as Full diagnostic data.</p> <p>If an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) to manage the account it provides to you and enrolls your device in the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration, Microsoft’s processing of diagnostic data in connection with Windows is governed by a contract between Microsoft and the organization. If an organization uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device, Microsoft and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management, monitoring, and troubleshooting of your devices managed by the organization, and for other purposes of the organization.</p> <p><strong>Required diagnostic data</strong> includes information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. We collect the following Required diagnostic data:</p> <ul> <li>Device, connectivity, and configuration data:<ul> <li>Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.</li> <li>Network capabilities and connection data such as the device’s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.</li> <li>Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics data settings, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.</li> <li>Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.</li> <li>Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.</li> <li>Whether updates complete successfully or fail.</li> <li>Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.</li> <li>Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device. For example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Optional diagnostic data</strong> includes more detailed information about your device and its settings, capabilities, and device health. Optional diagnostic data also includes data about the websites you browse, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users. When you choose to send Optional diagnostic data, Required diagnostic data will always be included, and we collect the following additional information:</p> <ul> <li>Additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected under Required diagnostic data.</li> <li>Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under Required diagnostic data.</li> <li>App activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input.</li> <li>Browser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer).</li> <li>Enhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred). Crash data is never used for Tailored experiences as described below.</li> </ul> <p>Some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if you choose to send Optional diagnostic data. Microsoft minimizes the volume of Optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data from only a subset of devices (sample). By running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device. Instructions for how to download the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool can be found in the Windows settings app under Diagnostics &amp; feedback.</p> <p>Specific data items collected in Windows diagnostics are subject to change to give Microsoft flexibility to collect the data needed for the purposes described. For example, to enable Microsoft to troubleshoot the latest performance issue impacting users’ computing experience or update a Windows device that is new to the market, Microsoft may need to collect data items that were not collected previously. For a current list of data types collected at <strong>Required diagnostic data</strong> and <strong>Optional diagnostic data</strong>, see <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/basic-level-windows-diagnostic-events-and-fields>Windows Required (Basic level) diagnostic events and fields</a> or <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/windows-diagnostic-data>Windows Optional (Full level) diagnostic data</a>. We provide limited portions of error report information to partners (such as the device manufacturer) to help them troubleshoot products and services which work with Windows and other Microsoft product and services. They are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those products and services. We may also share some aggregated, de-identified diagnostic data, such as general usage trends for Windows apps and features, with selected third parties. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=614828">Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows</a>.</p> <p><strong>Inking and typing Recognition</strong>. You also can choose to help Microsoft improve inking and typing recognition by sending inking and typing diagnostic data. If you choose to do so, Microsoft will collect samples of the content you type or write to improve features such as handwriting recognition, autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many languages used by Microsoft customers. When Microsoft collects inking and typing diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original content or associate the input to you. It also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=614828">Learn more about improving inking and typing in Windows</a>.</p> <p>If you choose to turn on <strong>Tailored experiences</strong>, we will use your Windows diagnostic data (Required or Optional as you have selected) to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft experiences. If you have selected Required as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. If you have selected Optional, personalization is also based on information about how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device. However, we do not use information about the websites you browse, the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data from customers who have selected Optional.</p> <p>Tailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize Windows, as well as ads and recommendations for Microsoft and third-party products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your Windows experiences. For example, to help you get the most out of your device, we may tell you about features you may not know about or that are new. If you are having a problem with your Windows device, you may be offered a solution. You may be offered a chance to customize your lock screen with pictures, or to be shown more pictures of the kind you like, or fewer of the ones you don’t. If you stream movies in your browser, you may be recommended an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. Or, if you are running out of space on your hard drive, Windows may recommend you try OneDrive or purchase hardware to gain more space. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=614828">Learn more about tailored experiences in Windows</a>.</p> <h4 id=feedback-hub>Feedback Hub<a class=headerlink href=#feedback-hub title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Feedback Hub is a preinstalled app that provides a way to gather feedback on Microsoft products and installed first party and third-party apps. You can sign into Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or an account provided by your organization (such as your employer or school) that you use to sign into Microsoft products. Signing in with your work or school account allows you to submit feedback to Microsoft in association with your organization.</p> <p>Any feedback you provide whether using your work or school account or personal Microsoft account may be publicly viewable depending on the settings configured by your organization’s administrators. Additionally, if feedback is provided using your work or school account, your feedback can be viewed through the Feedback Hub by your organization’s administrators.</p> <p>When you submit feedback to Microsoft about a problem or add more details to a problem, diagnostic data will be sent to Microsoft to improve Microsoft products and services. Depending on your Diagnostic data settings in the <strong>Diagnostics &amp; feedback</strong> section of the Windows settings app, Feedback Hub will either send diagnostic data automatically or you will have the option to send it to Microsoft at the time you provide feedback. Based on the category chosen when submitting feedback, there may be additional personal data collected that helps to further troubleshoot issues; for example, location related information when submitting feedback about location services or gaze related information when submitting feedback on Mixed Reality. Microsoft may also share your feedback along with the data collected when you submit your feedback with Microsoft partners (such as a device manufacturer, or firmware developer) to help them troubleshoot products and services that work with Windows and other Microsoft products and services. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=614828">Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows</a>.</p> <h4 id=location-services-and-recording>Location services and recording<a class=headerlink href=#location-services-and-recording title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p><strong>Windows location service</strong>. Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device. Depending on the capabilities of the device, the device’s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely. When you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected. This de-identified location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see <a href=https://www.here.com>https://www.here.com/</a>) and Skyhook (see <a href=https://www.skyhook.com>https://www.skyhook.com</a>) to improve the location services of the provider.</p> <p>Windows services and features, apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device’s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so. Some features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device’s location. For information about certain Windows apps that use the device’s location, see the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainwindowsappsmodule>Windows apps</a> section of this privacy statement.</p> <p>When an app or feature accesses the device’s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you’ve granted permission. We will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one). Data about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history. You can clear your device's location history at any time in the Windows settings app.</p> <p>In the Windows settings app, you can also view which apps have access to the device’s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device’s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device’s location. You can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can’t detect a more exact location for your device.</p> <p>Even when you’ve turned off access to the device’s location, some third-party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the device’s precise location. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007461">Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device’s location when the device’s location setting is off</a>.</p> <p>In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings. If your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device’s location. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=529987">Learn more about location in Windows</a>.</p> <p><strong>General Location</strong>. If you turn on Location services, apps that cannot use your precise location may still have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.</p> <p><strong>Find my device</strong>. The Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices. To enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled. This feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps. When the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=533063">Learn more about Find my device in Windows</a>.</p> <p><strong>Recording</strong>. Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others. If you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device. In some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly. <strong>Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication. This may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.</strong> Microsoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.</p> <h4 id=security-and-safety-features>Security and safety features<a class=headerlink href=#security-and-safety-features title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p><strong>Device encryption</strong>. Device encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology. When device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key. The BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account. Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.</p> <p><strong>Malicious Software Removal Tool</strong>. The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update. MSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software ("malware") and helps remove any infections found. When the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device. During a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device. If you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.</p> <p><strong>Microsoft Family</strong>. Parents can use Microsoft Family to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device. There are many features available to Family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you create or join a Family. If you live in a region that requires permission to create an account to access Microsoft services, you may be prompted to request or give parental consent. If a user is under the statutory age in your region, during the registration process they will be prompted to request consent from a parent or guardian by entering an adult’s email. When Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities. Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers after a short period of time.</p> <p><strong>Microsoft Defender SmartScreen</strong>. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device. When checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the download location, and the file's digital certificates. If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file. When checking web content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content. If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in Settings.</p> <p><strong>Microsoft Defender Antivirus</strong>. Microsoft Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device. Microsoft Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device. If Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device. When Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files for further inspection. If a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent. You can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.</p> <h4 id=speech-voice-activation-inking-and-typing>Speech, Voice Activation, Inking, and Typing<a class=headerlink href=#speech-voice-activation-inking-and-typing title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p><strong>Speech</strong>. Microsoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technologies.</p> <p>Turning on the Online speech recognition setting lets apps use Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition. Additionally, in Windows 10, the Online speech recognition setting enables your ability to use dictation within Windows.</p> <p>Turning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions. Both device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled. With both settings enabled, while your headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input and will send your voice data to Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies.</p> <p>When you use cloud-based speech recognition technologies from Microsoft, whether enabled by the Online speech recognition setting or when you interact with HoloLens or voice typing, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to provide the speech recognition service by creating a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data. Microsoft will not listen to your voice recording without your permission. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainspeechrecognitionmodule>Speech recognition technologies</a>.</p> <p>You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft. However, Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition technologies provide more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition. When the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that don’t rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition—like the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app—will still work and Microsoft won’t collect any voice data.</p> <p>You can turn off online speech recognition at any time. This will stop any apps that rely on the Online speech recognition setting from sending your voice data to Microsoft. If you are using a HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any time. This will stop the device from listening for your voice input. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=874646">Learn more about speech recognition in Windows</a>.</p> <p><strong>Voice Activation</strong>. Windows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that app—for example allowing Cortana to listen and respond when you say “Cortana.”</p> <p>If you’ve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, Windows will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords. Once a keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer. The app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to process the commands. Each app should ask you for permission before accessing voice recordings.</p> <p>Additionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked. If enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who speaks near the device. When the device is locked, the app will have access to the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked.</p> <p>You can turn off voice activation at any time. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=874646">Learn more about voice activation in Windows</a>.</p> <p>Even when you’ve turned off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services could still be listening to the microphone and collect your voice input. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007461">Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to access your microphone even with these settings turned off</a>.</p> <p><strong>Voice typing</strong>. In Windows 11, dictation has been updated and renamed as voice typing. Like dictation, voice typing uses online speech recognition technologies to power its speech-to-text transcription service. You can also choose to contribute voice clips to help improve voice typing. If you choose not to contribute voice clips, you can still use voice typing. You can change your choice anytime in the voice typing settings. Microsoft will not listen to your voice recordings without your permission. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=874646">Learn more about voice typing in Windows</a>.</p> <p><strong>Inking &amp; Typing Personalization</strong>. Your typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you with: a personal dictionary, better character recognition to help you type and write on your device, and text suggestions that appear as you type or write.</p> <p>You can turn off Inking &amp; typing personalization at any time. This will delete data stored on your device, such as your personal dictionary. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=544945">Learn more about inking &amp; typing personalization in Windows</a>.</p> <h4 id=sync-and-backup-settings>Sync and backup settings<a class=headerlink href=#sync-and-backup-settings title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>When you sign into Windows with your Microsoft account or work or school account, Windows can store your settings, files, and device configuration data in Microsoft’s servers. Windows will only use the stored settings, files, and device configuration data to make it easier for you to migrate your experience on a different device.</p> <p>You can turn off this feature and stop Windows from storing your settings, files, and configuration data from the Windows settings app. You can also delete the sync and backup data Windows has stored in the settings app.</p> <p><a href=https://support.microsoft.com/windows/about-sync-settings-on-windows-10-devices-deebcba2-5bc0-4e63-279a-329926955708>Learn more how your settings and data is collected, used, and stored by Sync settings</a>.</p> <p>For Windows 11 only, <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2172845">learn more about how your settings, files, and configuration data is collected, used, and stored by Windows backup</a>.</p> <h4 id=update-services>Update Services<a class=headerlink href=#update-services title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Update Services for Windows includes Windows Update and Microsoft Update. Windows Update is a service that provides you with software updates for Windows software and other supporting software, such as drivers and firmware supplied by device manufacturers. Microsoft Update is a service that provides you with software updates for other Microsoft software such as Microsoft 365.</p> <p>Windows Update automatically downloads Windows software updates to your device. You can configure Windows Update to automatically install these updates as they become available (recommended) or have Windows notify you when a restart is required to finish installing updates. Apps available through the Microsoft Store are automatically updated through the Microsoft Store, as described in the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainwindowsstoremodule>Microsoft Store</a> section of this privacy statement.</p> <h4 id=web-browsersmicrosoft-edge-legacy-and-internet-explorer>Web browsers—Microsoft Edge Legacy and Internet Explorer<a class=headerlink href=#web-browsersmicrosoft-edge-legacy-and-internet-explorer title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>This section applies to legacy versions of Microsoft Edge (versions 44 and below). See the <a href=https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainmsedgemodule>Microsoft Edge</a> section of the Privacy Statement for information about non-legacy versions of Microsoft Edge.</p> <p>Microsoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows. Internet Explorer, the legacy browser from Microsoft, is also available in Windows. Whenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device ("standard device data") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites' web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. Additionally, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to certain websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser features and services.</p> <p>Additionally, data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Delete Browsing History.</p> <p>Microsoft Edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Web note</strong>. Allows you to create ink and text annotations on the webpages you visit, and clip, save, or share them.</li> <li><strong>Active reading</strong>. Allows you to create and manage reading lists, including websites or documents.</li> <li><strong>Hub</strong>. Allows you to easily manage your reading lists, favorites, downloads, and history all in one area.</li> <li><strong>Website Pin to Taskbar</strong>. Allows you to pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites.</li> </ul> <p>Some Microsoft browser information saved on your device will be synced across other devices when you sign in with your Microsoft account. For instance, in Internet Explorer, this information includes your browsing history and favorites; and in Microsoft Edge, it includes your favorites, reading lists, autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), and may include data for extensions that you have installed. As an example, if you sync your Microsoft Edge reading list across devices, copies of the content you choose to save to your reading list will be sent to each synced device for later viewing. You can disable syncing in Internet Explorer by going to <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Sync your settings</strong>.

If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.</p> <p>When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.</p> <p><strong>Photos app</strong>. The Photos app helps you organize and share your photos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by date, location, tags, and faces. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Album tab helps users organize their photos and videos by location and common tags. The People tab helps you organize your photos and videos by grouping photos and videos with similar faces, which you can then associate with contacts.</p> <p>If you enable the People setting on the Photos app's settings page, the app will use face grouping technologies to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.</p> <p>If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video. If enabled, facial groupings are only accessible to you, on that device, within the Photos app and the groups and grouping data are not embedded in any shared photos or videos. You, and not Microsoft, are responsible for ensuring you have appropriate permissions from the people in your photos and videos to use facial grouping technology to group your photos and videos in your personal albums.</p> <p>Your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, you will be prompted to allow the Photos app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos app to turn the People setting on or off. This will remove facial grouping data from the Photos app, but will not remove your photos or videos. <a href=https://support.microsoft.com/windows/group-photos-by-faces-1ab09703-f0a6-5835-d27b-58672b23fdd2>Learn more about the Photos app and facial grouping</a>.</p> <p><strong>People app</strong>.

When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.</p> <p><strong>Mail and Calendar app</strong>. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.</p> <p><strong>Messaging app</strong>. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time.

This service lets you find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks. You can connect to the Xbox network using Xbox consoles, Windows devices, and mobile devices (Android and iPhone).</p> <p>When you sign up for an Xbox profile, we assign you a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier. When you sign in on Xbox devices, apps, and services, the data we collect about your use is stored using these unique identifier(s).</p> <p>Xbox consoles are devices you can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment. When you sign in to Xbox experiences—in apps or on a console—we also assign a unique identifier to your device. When your Xbox console is connected to the internet, for instance, and you sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system you’re using.</p> <p>Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as the Xbox network and cloud gaming. When signed in to an Xbox experience, we collect required data to help keep these experiences reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected.</p> <p><strong>Data we collect</strong> about your use of Xbox services, games, apps, and consoles includes:</p> <ul> <li>When you sign in and sign out of Xbox, any purchases you make, and content you obtain.</li> <li>Which games you play and apps you use, your game progress, achievements, play time per game, and other play statistics.</li> <li>Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected accessories, and your network connection, including any software or hardware errors.</li> <li>Content you add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video you capture in games and apps.</li> <li>Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections you make (friends you add and people who follow you) on the Xbox network.</li> </ul> <p>If you use an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time you sign in to Xbox, even if you’ve been playing offline.</p> <p><strong>Xbox console diagnostic data</strong>. Diagnostic data has two categories: required and optional. If you use an Xbox console, the console will send required data to Microsoft. Optional data is additional data that you choose to share with Microsoft.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Required</strong>. The minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.</li> <li><strong>Optional</strong>. Optional data includes additional details about your console, its settings, its health, its use, and enhanced error reporting to help us detect, diagnose, and fix problems.</li> </ul> <p>Learn more at <a href=https://www.xbox.com/managedatacollection>Manage settings for optional data sharing</a>.</p> <p><strong>Game captures</strong>. Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play. Other players’ game clips and screenshots can capture your in-game character and gamertag during that session. If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat.</p> <p><strong>Captioning</strong>. During Xbox real-time (“party”) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text. If a player activates this feature, all voice communication in the party is captioned for the player. Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it, as well as the other purposes described in this statement.</p> <p><strong>Data use</strong>. Microsoft uses the data we collect to improve gaming products and experiences—making them safer and more fun over time.</p> <p>Data we collect also enables us to provide you with personalized, curated experiences. This includes connecting you to games, content, and services, as well as presenting you with offers, discounts, and recommendations.</p> <p><strong>Xbox data viewable by others</strong>. Your gamertag, game and play statistics, achievements, presence (whether you are currently signed in to Xbox), content you share, and other data about your activity on Xbox can be seen by:</p> <ul> <li>Other players signed in to Xbox.</li> <li>Customers of third-party services you’ve linked your profile to, or</li> <li>Other services associated with Xbox (including those of partner companies).</li> </ul> <p>For example, your gamertag and scores that show on game leaderboards are considered public and cannot be hidden. For other data, you can adjust your privacy settings on consoles and at <a href=https://www.xbox.com/ >Xbox.com</a> to limit or block what is shared with the public or with friends.</p> <p>Learn more at <a href=https://support.xbox.com/help/friends-social-activity/community/use-safety-settings>Use your safety settings</a>.</p> <p><strong>Xbox data shared with third parties including game and apps publishers</strong>.

You should carefully review their policies to determine how they use the data. For example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services. You may find their policies linked from game or app detail pages in the Microsoft Store.</p> <p>Learn more at <a href=https://www.xbox.com/Legal/ThirdPartyDataSharing>Data Sharing with Games and Apps</a>.</p> <p>To stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where you have installed them.

For example:</p> <ul> <li>If you choose, the camera can be used to sign you in to the Xbox network automatically using facial recognition. This data stays on the console and is not shared with anyone, and you can choose to delete this data from your console at any time.</li> <li>For game play, Kinect will map distances between your body's joints to create a stick figure representation of you that helps Kinect enable play.</li> <li>The Kinect microphone can enable voice chat between players during play. The microphone also enables voice commands for control of the console, game, or app, or to enter search terms.</li> <li>The Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communications through services such as Skype.</li> </ul> <p>Learn more about Kinect at <a href=https://aka.ms/kinectprivacy/ >Xbox Kinect and Privacy</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id=microsoft-store>Microsoft Store<a class=headerlink href=#microsoft-store title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Microsoft Store is an online service, accessible via PC, the Xbox Console and the Xbox App, that allows you to browse, download, purchase, rate, and review applications and other digital content. It includes:</p> <ul> <li>Apps and content for Windows devices such as phones, PCs, and tablets.</li> <li>Games, subscriptions and other apps for Xbox consoles and other devices.</li> <li>Products and apps for Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Access, and Project (2013 versions or later).</li> </ul> <p>We collect data about how you access and use Microsoft Store; the products you've viewed, purchased, or installed; the preferences you set for viewing apps in Microsoft Store; and any ratings, reviews, or problem reports you submit. Your Microsoft account is associated with your ratings and reviews; and if you write a review, the name and picture from your Microsoft account will be published with your review.</p> <p><strong>Permission for Microsoft Store apps</strong>. Many apps you install from the Microsoft Store are designed to take advantage of specific hardware and software features of your device. An app's use of certain hardware and software features may give the app or its related service access to your data. For example, a photo editing app might access your device's camera to let you take a new photo or access photos or videos stored on your device for editing, and a restaurant guide might use your location to provide nearby recommendations. Information about the features that an app uses is provided on the app's product description page in Microsoft Store. Many of the features that Microsoft Store apps use can be turned on or off through your device’s privacy settings. In Windows, in many cases, you can choose which apps can use a particular feature. Go to <strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy or Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, select the feature (for example, Calendar), and then select which app permissions are on or off. The lists of apps in Windows privacy settings that can use hardware and software features will not include "Classic Windows" applications, and these applications are not affected by these settings.</p> <p><strong>App updates</strong>. Unless you have turned off automatic app updates in the relevant Microsoft Store settings or have acquired an app provided and updated by the app developer, Microsoft Store will automatically check for, download, and install app updates to verify that you have the latest versions. Updated apps might use different Windows hardware and software features from the previous versions, which could give them access to different data on your device. You will be prompted for consent if an updated app accesses certain features, such as location. You can also review the hardware and software features an app uses by viewing its product description page in Microsoft Store.</p> <p>Each app's use of your data collected through any of these features is subject to the app developer's privacy policies. If an app available through Microsoft Store collects and uses any of your personal data, the app developer is required to provide a privacy policy, and a link to the privacy policy is available on the app's product description page in Microsoft Store.</p> <p><strong>Sideloaded apps and developer mode</strong>. Developer features such as the "developer mode" setting are intended for development use only. If you enable developer features, your device may become unreliable or unusable, and expose you to security risks. Downloading or otherwise acquiring apps from sources other than Microsoft Store, also known as "sideloading" apps, may make your device and personal data more vulnerable to attack or unexpected use by apps. Windows policies, notifications, permissions, and other features intended to help protect your privacy when apps access your data may not function as described in this statement for sideloaded apps or when developer features are enabled.</p> <h4 id=msn>MSN<a class=headerlink href=#msn title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>MSN services include websites and a suite of apps, including MSN News, Weather, Sports, and Money, and previous versions of the apps branded as Bing (together, "MSN Apps").

You can turn off or configure application storage in the Silverlight Configuration tool.</p> <p><strong>Silverlight updates</strong>. Silverlight will periodically check a Microsoft server for updates to provide you with the latest features and improvements. A small file containing information about the latest Silverlight version will be downloaded to your computer and compared to your currently installed version. If a newer version is available, it will be downloaded and installed on your computer. You can turn off or configure updates in the Silverlight Configuration tool.</p> <p><strong>Digital Rights Management</strong>. Silverlight uses Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to help protect the rights of content owners. If you access DRM-protected content (such as music or video) with Silverlight, it will request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet. In order to provide a seamless playback experience, you will not be prompted before Silverlight sends the request to the rights server. When requesting media usage rights, Silverlight will provide the rights server with an ID for the DRM-protected content file and basic data about your device, including data about the DRM components on your device such as their revision and security levels, and a unique identifier for your device.</p> <p><strong>DRM updates</strong>. In some cases, accessing DRM-protected content will require an update to Silverlight or to the DRM components on your device. When you attempt to play content that requires a DRM update, Silverlight will send a request to a Microsoft server containing basic data about your device, including information about the DRM components on your computer such as their revision and security levels, troubleshooting data, and a unique identifier for your device. The Microsoft server uses this identifier to return a unique DRM update for your device, which will then be installed by Silverlight. You can turn off or configure DRM component updates on the <strong>Playback</strong> tab in the Silverlight Configuration tool.</p> <h4 id=windows-mixed-reality>Windows Mixed Reality<a class=headerlink href=#windows-mixed-reality title="Permanent link">#</a></h4> <p>Windows Mixed Reality allows you to enable a virtual reality experience that immerses you in apps and games.
